Hi, I'm Vincent! I'm a soon to be Master's graduate in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence at Paris-Saclay University.
Coming from a more mathematical oriented background, I've developed a keen interest for solving complex tasks and projects through the use of Machine Learning, Aritficial Intelligence and statistics.
My expertise covers a wide range of AI domains but you can find a selection of finished projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ledvincent) page.
